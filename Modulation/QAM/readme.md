# ðŸ”² Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) Simulation Project  

## Overview ðŸš€  
This project demonstrates the simulation of **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)**, specifically **16-QAM**.  
QAM is a **digital modulation technique** that conveys data by varying both the **amplitude** and **phase** of a carrier signal.  
The simulation generates a **digital message**, modulates it into QAM symbols, adds noise, and visualizes both the **constellation diagram** and **received noisy signal**.

## Why Study QAM? ðŸ“¡  
- **High Spectral Efficiency:** Transmits multiple bits per symbol (16-QAM = 4 bits per symbol).  
- **Widely Used:** Basis of modern digital communication systems (Wi-Fi, LTE, DVB).  
- **Practical Learning:** Visualizes symbol mapping and constellation distortion due to noise.

## Simulation Results ðŸ“Š  
- **Transmitted Constellation:** Ideal 16-QAM constellation points in the I/Q plane.  
- **Received Constellation:** Noisy points scattered around the ideal grid (distortion visible at lower SNR).  
- **Bit Error Rate (BER):** Calculated by comparing transmitted and received symbols.

## Future Enhancements ðŸ”®  
- Implement **QAM demodulation** with Gray coding for efficient bit mapping.  
- Explore **higher-order QAM** (e.g., 64-QAM, 256-QAM) to analyze trade-offs between data rate and noise robustness.
