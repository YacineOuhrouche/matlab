# ðŸ“¶ Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) Simulation Project  

## Overview ðŸš€  
This project demonstrates the simulation of **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**.  
FSK is a **digital modulation technique** where the **frequency of a carrier signal** changes according to the binary input data.  
The simulation generates a **digital message**, two **carrier frequencies** for `0` and `1`, and the resulting **FSK waveform**, visualizing both the **message and modulated signal**.

## Why Study FSK? ðŸ“¡  
- **Noise-Resistant Digital Modulation:** Frequency changes make FSK less susceptible to amplitude noise.  
- **Fundamental in Communications:** Basis for many modem and digital radio systems.  
- **Visual Clarity:** Easy to observe frequency changes corresponding to digital bits.

## Simulation Results ðŸ“Š  
- **Message Signal:** Sequence of binary bits (`0` and `1`).  
- **Carrier Signals:** Two reference carriers at 50 Hz and 100 Hz.  
- **FSK Signal:** Carrier frequency switches according to the message bits.  
- **Visual Observation:** Low-frequency segments correspond to bit 0, high-frequency segments correspond to bit 1.
