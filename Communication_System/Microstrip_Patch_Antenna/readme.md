# üì° Microstrip Patch Antenna (Strip-Fed Slot) Project  

## Overview üöÄ  
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **strip-fed slot microstrip patch antenna** using **MATLAB Antenna Toolbox**.  
The antenna is designed on an **FR4 PCB substrate** to operate near **1.94 GHz**, and includes custom slot shapes to modify bandwidth and improve matching.

## Design Description üõ†Ô∏è  
- The **top layer** contains the patch and custom slot geometry.  
- The **bottom layer** is a full ground plane.  
- The **substrate** is FR4 dielectric between the patch and ground.  
- A **strip-fed slot** feed is used to excite the antenna.  
- Slots are added to the patch to adjust the current path, tuning bandwidth and frequency.
