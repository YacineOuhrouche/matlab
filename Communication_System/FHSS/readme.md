# üì° Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) Simulation in MATLAB  

## Overview üöÄ  
This project demonstrates the simulation of a **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)** communication system in MATLAB.  
FHSS is a **spread spectrum modulation technique** where the **carrier frequency changes (hops)** according to a predefined hopping sequence.

## Why Study FHSS? üì∂  
- **Anti-Jamming:** Frequency hopping makes it difficult for narrowband interferers to disrupt communication.  
- **Security:** The hopping sequence acts as a "key," preventing unauthorized receivers from decoding.  
- **Multipath Resistance:** Reduces effects of fading in wireless channels.  
- **Practical Relevance:** FHSS is used in **Bluetooth**, **military radios**, and **satellite communications**.

## Simulation Description üõ†Ô∏è  
1. **Data Generation:**  
   - A binary message sequence (0s and 1s) is generated.  

2. **Digital Modulation:**  
   - Each bit is mapped to a baseband modulated signal  

3. **Hopping Sequence:**  
   - A **pseudo-random hopping sequence** is generated that selects the carrier frequency for each bit.  

4. **Carrier Hopping:**  
   - The baseband signal is upconverted to the carrier chosen by the hopping sequence.  
   - For bit `1`, a different carrier is chosen than for bit `0`.  

5. **FHSS Signal Transmission:**  
   - The final FHSS waveform is the concatenation of all hopped carriers carrying their respective modulated data.
