# ‚ö° Field-Oriented Control (FOC) of a PMSM ‚Äî MATLAB Simulation

This project demonstrates a **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)** implementation for a **Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)** using **MATLAB**.  
It models both the **electrical** and **mechanical** dynamics of the motor, with cascaded **current and speed control loops**, feedforward decoupling, and voltage saturation handling.  

The goal is to understand how FOC enables **precise torque and speed control**, which is widely used in **electric vehicle drives**, **industrial motor control**, and **high-performance servo systems**.

## üåÄ What is Field-Oriented Control (FOC)?

Field-Oriented Control (FOC), also known as **vector control**, is a method to control AC motors (like PMSMs or BLDC motors) by **decoupling torque and flux components** of stator currents.  
This allows the motor to behave **like a separately excited DC motor**, where flux and torque are independently controllable.

### Key Concepts:
- **dq-axis transformation:** Three-phase currents (`i_a, i_b, i_c`) are transformed into a **rotating reference frame** aligned with the rotor flux.  
  - `i_d` ‚Üí controls **magnetic flux**  
  - `i_q` ‚Üí controls **electromagnetic torque**  
- **Decoupling:** Cross-coupling between d- and q-axis is compensated via feedforward terms, improving dynamic performance.  
- **Nested Control Loops:**
  - **Inner loop:** Regulates dq currents at high bandwidth (~kHz range)  
  - **Outer loop:** Regulates speed or position at lower bandwidth  

### Advantages of FOC:
- Smooth and precise torque control  
- Fast dynamic response and accurate speed tracking  
- Reduced torque ripple and losses  
- Widely used in EVs, robotics, and industrial drives

## ‚öôÔ∏è PMSM Model Overview

The PMSM is modeled using **dq-axis voltage equations** and **mechanical dynamics**.  

### Electrical Dynamics:
$$
\begin{cases}
v_d = R_s i_d + L_d \dfrac{di_d}{dt} - \omega_e L_q i_q \\[2mm]
v_q = R_s i_q + L_q \dfrac{di_q}{dt} + \omega_e (L_d i_d + \lambda_m)
\end{cases}
$$


Where:  
- `v_d, v_q` ‚Üí dq-axis voltages applied by inverter  
- `i_d, i_q` ‚Üí dq-axis currents  
- `R_s, L_d, L_q` ‚Üí stator resistance and inductances  
- `Œª_m` ‚Üí permanent magnet flux linkage  
- `œâ_e` ‚Üí electrical angular speed  

### Mechanical Dynamics:
\[
J \frac{d\omega_m}{dt} + B \omega_m = T_e - T_{load}
\]  
Where:  
- `J` ‚Üí rotor inertia  
- `B` ‚Üí viscous friction  
- `T_e` ‚Üí electromagnetic torque (`3/2 * p * (Œª_m i_q + (L_d-L_q) i_d i_q)`)  
- `T_load` ‚Üí applied mechanical load
