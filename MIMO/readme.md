# üì° MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) System Simulation in MATLAB  

## Overview üöÄ  
This project demonstrates the simulation of a **2x2 MIMO system** using **16-QAM modulation** in MATLAB.  
The simulation evaluates the **Bit Error Rate (BER)** performance of two linear detection techniques:  
- **Zero Forcing (ZF)**  
- **Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)**

## Simulation Description üõ†Ô∏è  
- Random data bits are generated and **16-QAM modulated**.  
- Data passes through a **2√ó2 Rayleigh fading channel**.  
- **AWGN noise** is added to simulate realistic wireless conditions.  
- At the receiver:  
  - **Zero Forcing (ZF):** Uses pseudoinverse of channel matrix for detection.  
  - **MMSE:** Improves on ZF by considering noise power in the equalizer.  
- Demodulation converts received symbols back to bits.  
- **BER is calculated** by comparing transmitted and received bits.

## Future Enhancements üîÆ  
- Extend to **4x4 MIMO** for higher capacity gains.  
- Implement **Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD)** for optimal performance.  
- Simulate **OFDM-MIMO** (basis of 4G/5G systems).
